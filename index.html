                <h2>I'm Jordan and I love sustainability!</h2>
                <p>My passion is DIY sustainability. I first became interested in it while building my own backyard brick oven from recycled bricks I was gifted from a nearby demolition site. That was the spark I needed, and since then I've been helping others upgrade their homes to include features that are environmentally friendly, help get them at least a little off the grid, and save them money in the long run. I am available for consultation, planning, and execution of any sustainable home improvement project. I like my clients to get involved, so expect to get your hands dirty with me!</p>

                <p>Install solar panels? I've done it. Design and build rain water collection? I've done it. Set up a composting bin and learn how to use it? I've done it. Raise goats? Convert your car to run on vegetable oil? Grow an indoor vegetable garden? I've done it, I've done it, I've done it! Whatever project you can think of to improve your home or lifestyle in an environmentally conscious way, I probably have experience with it.</p>

                <p>Call me to discuss your ideas or project. Or call me to ask what you can do with your current property. I'll come out at no charge and give you an honest assessment. In the meantime, explore the rest of this site to see some of my recent projects from planning to completion.</p>
